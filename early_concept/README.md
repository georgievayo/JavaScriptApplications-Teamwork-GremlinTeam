##### *from team meeting on 20/04/2017*

#### Create a simple app for cooking recipes - original idea by ***georgievayo***

 - use [plotly](https://plot.ly/javascript/) or [D3](https://d3js.org/) for visualizing recipe nutrition
 - allow for basic social media integration (comments, Facebook like button, Twitter)
 - [some sample recipes](https://trello.com/b/vJ5IzCGd/recipes) for easy testing

##### *from team meeting on 22/04/2017*

#### Create initial landing page mock-up

- Recent recipes button on top bar - last 10
- Popular recipes button on top bar - 10 with most likes
- Full archive button on top bar - all recipes grouped alphabetically
- About button on top bar - team info, contact, links

- Login button
- Register button

- Landing page image 

- ***App name?***
